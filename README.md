# 🌑 Solution - Where Charm Meets Dread

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Solution - Where Charm Meets Dread**.  
Our world is built around mystery, humor, and emotional storytelling, a balance between unsettling beauty and quiet chaos.

## 🧩 About the Project

**Solution** is a hand-drawn, line-art horror game that blends atmospheric storytelling with puzzle-solving, stealth, and combat inspired by *Elden Ring*.  
Set in a decaying world of mechanical life and forgotten humanity, the story unfolds across three acts, each filled with unique scenes, secrets, and choices that shape the outcome.

Expect:
- Story-rich gameplay with cinematic flair  
- Character-driven lore told through notes, dialogue, and exploration  
- Puzzles and tense encounters that test both wit and instinct  
- Occasional humor to remind you the world isn’t *completely* doomed
